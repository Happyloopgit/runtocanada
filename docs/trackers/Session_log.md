## Session Guidelines

### When to Create a New Session Entry

Create a new session entry when:
- Starting a new development session (new day or after a significant break)

- Switching to a different sprint
- Making significant changes worth documenting

### What to Include in Work Completed

Document:
- Which sprint tasks were completed
- Key features or components implemented
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring or improvements
- Testing completed

### Files Modified Format

Use this format for clarity:
- **Created:** `path/to/new/file.dart` - Brief description of what it contains
- **Modified:** `path/to/existing/file.dart` - What changed
- **Deleted:** `path/to/old/file.dart` - Why it was removed
- **Renamed:** `old/path.dart` → `new/path.dart` - Reason for rename

### Issues Encountered

Document all issues encountered, even if resolved:
- What went wrong
- Error messages (if applicable)
- How it was debugged
- Final solution
- Reference to bug tracker if bug was logged

This helps others who might encounter the same issue.
