# Run to Canada - Product Concept Document

## Executive Summary

**App Name:** Run to Canada

**Tagline:** Turn every run into a journey to somewhere meaningful

**Core Concept:** A gamified running tracker that transforms accumulated running distance into a virtual journey toward real-world destinations, making fitness goals tangible and emotionally engaging.

---

## Product Vision

Traditional running apps focus on metrics and competition. Run to Canada creates an emotional connection by letting users visualize their cumulative running distance as progress toward places they care about—whether that's Canada, their hometown, or a dream destination.

Instead of "I ran 100km this month" (abstract), users say "I ran from NYC to Philadelphia!" (tangible achievement).
